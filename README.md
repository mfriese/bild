Fast Photo management application to create a very simple structure one
can easily browse with the File Explorer of one's OS. It seems there are
a lot of these type of applications but none does what I want so here we
go, another management tool.

So far I have uses apple photos but it becomes very slow on large libraries
and my library is huge. Since I don't want to be dependant on a specific
application by some provider anymore I have created this program.

## Ideas I follow
- Organize by year
- Organize by media type (audio, video, picture and text)
- Don't integrate a viewer (so far), let the OS handle this
- Add search feature
